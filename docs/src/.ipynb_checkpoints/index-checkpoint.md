# Falcons
Welcome to FLCONS(Fast Algorithm for Locus Computing ON the Sky).
FALCONS is a software that rapidly calculates the tod of pointing information required for satellite observation simulations.
FALCONS supports multi-detectors and can construct a focal plane by specifying (theta,phi) arrays centered on the boresight.
The mapmaking function creates a crosslink map from the rapidly obtained time series pointing information.
